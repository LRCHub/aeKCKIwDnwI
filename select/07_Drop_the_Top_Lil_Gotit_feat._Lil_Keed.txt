I put this drip together, just like a rockstar
Don't know 'bout red light, we smash up cop cars
I talk 'bout money, niggas talk cheap
How the hell you spent 50 bands in a week?
I'm shoppin' Rodeo, start rappin', it pays more
I smoke the best, exotic fresh off the tree
Got VVS, this water by G
It fit my wrist, a new Patek Phillipe
Ah, brand new coupe, I drop the top (Hood Baby)

Only 19 and I never had a job (It's crazy)
No disrespectin', yeah, I get her wetter by tomorrow (On God)
I'm on a jet, I got a clear view (Let's go)
She want Chanel, not Jimmy Choo (Cha-nay-nay)
She think I'm from the avenue (Oh no)
Ran up them racks, got revenue (Racks)
Lil' bitch, fuck you
I didn't flood my wrist for you
Shoot shit up 'bout all my bros (Audemars)
She thought I was thinkin' the way I stuffed it (Audemars)
I'm gettin' racks now, they let us through, no pat-down
My brother let me on the 'Gram and I fumbled, I'm back now
She wanna fuck on Gotit (Gotit)
She tryna fuck my posse (Lil Gotit)
Her body of a goddess (Slatt)
You gone forever, I know, yeah, yeah (It's crazy)
Yeah, yeah (It's crazy, but it's true)
