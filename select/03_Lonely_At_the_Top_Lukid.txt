It's lonely at the top
I'd rather be in the middle,
Where the air is not so rare
Where people can hear my fiddle.

I guess I strove too hard
Caught a lucky break or two,
But it's there in the middle
I long to be with the rest of you.

I live up in this high castle
Above the clouds of life,
But I'd rather be down where
There's still some strife.

Life has become too easy
I'm on my perched chair,
Giving orders as I fancy
But I'd rather be down there...

With the rest of life's cares
With real dreams of making it,
Instead of things I regret
As I stare out lonely and blue.
