At the end of the sea
There waits my wind to carry me
Through storms we will sail
Just to gaze at the top of the world
From the bottom of the world
We looked up and saw the moon
And gazing at it then we fell
In love, in love
So we made up our minds
To arrive smiling
Yet we made up our minds
To touch the height of life
And find out what we felt for it
How we felt for it, oh, how we felt for it
From the top of the world
We looked up and saw the sun
And gazing at it then we fell
In love, in love
