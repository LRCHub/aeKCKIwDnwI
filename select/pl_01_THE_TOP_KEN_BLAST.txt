Final lap
I'm on top of the world
And I will never rest for
second again
One more time
I have beaten them out
The scent of gasoline
announces the end
They all said
I'd best give it up
What a fool,
to believe their lies!
Now they've fallen,
I'm at the top
Are you ready now to die?
I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive...
the top?
<♪>
One more turn
and I'll settle the score
A rubber fire screams
into the night
Crash and burn
is what you're gonna do
I am a master of the
asphalt fight
They all said
I'd best give it up
What a fool,
to believe their lies!
Now they've fallen,
I'm at the top
Are you ready now to die?
I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive...
I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive...
the top?
<♪>
I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive...
I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive...
the top?

I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!

And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive...
