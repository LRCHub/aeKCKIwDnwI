Assimilate to the start
Can't lose the cost of violence no, no, no
Close in I'm gonna find you won't let you go
And sink these in your heart, you're close
Yeah we'll assimilate to the stark
And lose the cost in silence no, no, no
Close-kill I'm gonna fire won't let you go
And dig this in your heart, you're close

We're going over the top
You said at worst we'll fend alone
We're going over the top
It's here we'll stand and die alone

Now if we're gonna fight this hour
Then God I'm gonna see this through
Fall in again
Your sovereign love is down
Your sovereign love is dead

Did you hear the diving bombs?
Did you see the dying ones? Long gone
Did you feel the crying ones?
That sink deep in your heart
Close in I'm gonna find you won't let you go
Addicted to the heart

I'll wield and lead us headlong, brace men
I'll wield and lead, we've lost control
You call this the win?
Into the graves we've sown
